NAME
    moodle_ - Plugin for generating various Moodle stats (Moodle 2.3 and
    above)

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration is done through libpq environment variables, for example
    PGUSER, PGHOST, etc. But generally it is easier if you run the plugin on
    the database server as postgres user. For more information, see
    Munin::Plugin::Pgsql and
    <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/plugin-conf.d>.

    In order to make this plugin work, you need to specify the name of the
    moodle database via symlink to the plugin, i.e.  moodle_<databasename>.
    For more information see
    <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/WildcardPlugins>.

    Plugin configuration variables:

    env.updatetime - you may configure the period for which the time-based
    data is calculated (e.g. used in the number of logged-in users reporting
    or assignments submissions). By default the value of 300 sec is used (5
    min Munin default update interval).

    env.mdlprefix - if you use different from 'mdl_' (mdl_tablename) prefix
    in database tables, pass the correct one using this parameter.

    env.modturnitintool - if you have Turnitintool module installed, you may
    add it to assignment monitoring by setting this variable to 1. Disabled
    by default.
